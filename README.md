### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

<br>
When it came ot indentifying software securtiy vulnerabilities, my strongest area came after finding what vulnerabilities had to be addressed.  Understanding where false positives exists and being able to research why they are false positives seems to be my most comfortable area but was still a challenging one.  Understanding these areas helps the company in its overall wellbeing by not only making sure that all dependencies are up to date which means they are as secure as they can be but also helps the developer be more efficient when securing the application.

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Even though I found it to be my strongest area, understanding the difference between false and not false positives is a huge challenge. The biggest challenge is understanding if there is a fix for a dependency or if its something that shold be ignored for now. The quick reference links within the dependency report was very helpful with researching each vulnerability.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

My first approach to increasing layers of security is first to review the application and see where the inputs and data tranfers will take place.  Once that is located, the next step is to implement validations.  The next layer would be to encrypt what ever data is being transferred or stored.  The last layer would be emplenenting encryptions for firewalls and securing the application to only use https.

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure that the code and software application was functional and secure, the application was ran before an after each bit of security code was added. To ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced, the dependency check was run before and after the completion of the code base.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

They main rescources that I found very useful that will be employed in future assignments would be use of the dependency check.  This check will help to find all dependency vulnerabilities.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would want to showcase my project two assignment.  The reason for this assignment is that its the assignment that I struggled most on but was also able to overcome many problems.  The showcase would consist of displaying the willingness to not give up on completing a project and taking all steps to overcome every challenge.  There were alot of challenges, some self made, that existed with this project which had to be overcome to achieve its completetion.
